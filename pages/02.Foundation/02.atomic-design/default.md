The web moves fast. Where once we could get away with designing pages as discrete objects, modern web design requires a design system that builds from the ground up, allowing us to iterate quickly while maintaining a consistent look and feel across
properties. By creating a rich, versatile library of reusable components, we can add new layouts quickly, without building up new [technical or design debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). While a new campaign or feature might require
the creation of a new component, new patterns come at a high costâ€”they require new design elements, additional code, maintenance, and they increase the [cognitive load](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) on users. The public part of this
guide focuses on the atoms - the basic building blocks of our digital presence. For an ongoing reference to the rest of our design patterns, visit our [Pattern Lab](http://vpatternlab/) instance (only available on Pega's network).

Atomic design flips the traditional model of web layout on its head. Rather than designing discrete *page templates* and breaking them down into CSS components, atomic design starts from the base-level components and works up to finished designs:

<div class="o-grid o-grid--flex">
<div class="o-grid__item u-1/1 u-1/2@small u-margin-bottom">
{% embed "@molecules/tiles/tile.twig" with {
  tile: {
    classes: "c-tile--small u-background-color-light-gray"
  }
} %}
  {% block tile_content %}
    {% include "@atoms/typography/headings/h3.twig" with {
      heading: {
        text: "Atoms"
      }
    } %}

    <p>The most basic elements of a web system - colors, fonts, grid, etc. These atoms form the basis of this guide.</p>
