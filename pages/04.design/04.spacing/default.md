The appropriate use of white space is essential for effective design and usability of site content. The goal of white space is to enhance readability of content, and to provide a clear visual hierarchy on the page. Ineffective use of white space makes a page look cluttered, disorganized and unprofessional. Additionally, poorly used white space inhibits usability and reading comprehension by making it difficult for users to visually comprehend distinct sections of the page. By incorporating [Gestalt principles of organization and grouping](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/) into our work, we can create better consistency within our designs.

To ensure appropriate spacing among elements, particularly in terms of content, we have established the _rule of 8s_.

* 8px: margin between related elements, e.g. heading and paragraph, label and form field;
* 16px: margin between related elements when more space is needed, e.g. between paragraphs, or between a paragraph and a call to action;
* 32px or 40px: margin between elements that should remain visually distinct.

Most Pega sites involve three primary ways of consuming content: 
1. **Long-form content**. This is the end goal of the majority of our users - to arrive at a piece of long-form content that they can consume, generally to learn something interesting. On these pages, focus on the legibility of text, and aim to minimize disruption to the reading flow.
2. **Landing pages**. These pages provide an overview with entry points into a variety of different content, generally organized by a specific topic, e.g. Pega Cloud or Accessibility. Focus here on providing a sensible path through the content, and using Gestalt principles such as [proximity](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/#proximity) or [common region](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/#common-regions).
3. **Content lists**. These pages focus on lists of items, generally with a brief teaser and certain key metadata supplied. The goal with these pages is to give people a way to organically find the specific information they're looking for, normally via Search. On these pages, the focus should be on giving people the ability to rapidly scan the page and find the main piece of information they're looking for.
